# Algorithms & Data structures

![alt text](turing.jpg)

The main goal of this repository is to be an educational tool for those who want to cone their skills in algorithms and data structures. To help you from drowning in the ocean of information online, we have gathered some resources to use for reading in each topic and  solved problems for you to practice. We recommend to try the problems on your own for at least 30-40 minutes before using the hints/solutions provided.

If you want to dive deeper in algorithms, we recommend the following books:
    * [Introduction to Algorithms, MIT](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)
    * [Algorithms by Papadimitriou, Vazirani, Dasgupta](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1177299)

For the topic structure we follow the [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/) book, which is a good choice if you are preparing for programming competitions ( IOI, ACM ICPC, etc. )
