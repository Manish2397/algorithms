# Algorithms & Data Structures

![alt text](turing.jpg)

This repository can serve as an educational tool for those who want to cone their skills in algorithms and data structures. To keep you from drowning in the ocean of information online, we have gathered some resources to use for reading in each topic and solved problems for you to practice. We recommend to try the problems on your own for at least 30-40 minutes before using the hints/solutions provided.

If you want to dive deeper in algorithms, we recommend the following books and courses:

* [Introduction to Algorithms, MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)
* [Algorithms by Papadimitriou, Vazirani, Dasgupta](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1177299)
* [MIT 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)
* [MIT 6.046J: Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP6317WaSNfmCvGym2ucw3oGp)

For the topic structure we follow the [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/) book, which is a good choice if you are preparing for programming competitions ( IOI, ACM ICPC, etc. )

## Structure

The problems in each topic are organized by subtopic or difficulty:

```
├── Topic1
|   |
|   ├── Resources.md
|   |                    
│   ├── Easy
│   │   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── Problem2
│   │   └── Problem3
|   |
|   └── Medium
│       ├── Problem1
│       ├── Problem2
│       └── Problem3
├── Topic2
|   |
|   ├── Resources.md
|   |                    
│   ├── Sub-topic1
│   │   └── Problem1
|   |
|   └── Sub-topic2
│       ├── Problem1
│       └── Problem2
.
