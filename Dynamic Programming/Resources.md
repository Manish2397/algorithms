### Resources for Dynamic Programming

We suggest to read from more than one source, in order to build a good intuition on the topic:

* MIT 6.006: [Lessons 19,20,21,22](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)
* TopCoder: [Dynamic Programming from Novice to Advanced](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)
* GeeksForGeeks
    * [Overlapping Subproblems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-1/)
    * [Tabulation vs Memoization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tabulation-vs-memoizatation/)
    * [Optimal Substructure Property](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-2-optimal-substructure-property/)
    * [How to solve a DP problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solve-dynamic-programming-problem/)  
* [How to write DP solutions](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-good-resources-or-tutorials-for-dynamic-programming-DP-besides-the-TopCoder-tutorial/answer/Michal-Danil√°k)

Here is a [quiz](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/cdbbfe83bcd64281964b788969247253) to test your knowledge.

For more advanced techniques ( DP with Bitmasks, etc. ) check out the Advanced Topics.
