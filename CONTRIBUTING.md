## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our repository!

### How can I contribute?

* Open issues for any bug or logical error found in a problem's solution
* Propose different solutions to existing problems or add new ones
* Add resources that you find helpful for understanding a topic

### Code of Conduct

All contributions to the repository are made through [pull requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

To keep our repository organized, you should follow the file structure found in [README.](README.md)
Also, a problem's folder should contain the solution in a programming language of your choice (C++, Python, Haskell, JS etc.) and a [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) briefly explaining your approach:

```
├── SomeRandomProblem
    ├── Solution.md
    └── source.py
```
Make sure your code is readable and can easily be followed by anyone interested in your solution.
For not wasting too much time on _Solution.md_, you can download and modify the [template.](SolutionTemplate.md)

Have fun coding!
